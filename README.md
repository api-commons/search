# Search

The common search vocabulary -- the indexes that hold searchable content, the documents and vectors in them, the queries run against them and the synonyms that tune them -- distilled from the APIs that already exist. Part of [Schema Commons](https://github.com/api-commons/schema-commons),
published by the [API Commons](https://apicommons.org).

Built from the providers tagged Search, Vector Search, Enterprise Search, Site Search, Search Engine, Semantic Search, Vector Database in [APIs.io](https://apis.io) that
publish their own OpenAPI. Only harvested contracts count -- nothing API Evangelist
generated. Every number below is a count of providers.

## What the market already agrees on

<!-- commons:summary -->
<!-- /commons:summary -->

Shares are of the providers with a readable resource schema for that concept. The
extended tier and the long tail of every concept are in [profile.yml](profile.yml).

## What the measurement shows

- 106 providers expose a search endpoint, and their queries and results agree on nothing -- not the query parameter, not the hit list, not the total. Search is the most common capability in the catalog with the least common shape.
- An index agrees only on name and id; document counts, vector dimensions and similarity metrics are each named by every engine its own way.
- Documents, vectors and synonyms are almost never resources of their own: they are written and read through the index (bulk endpoints, upserts) rather than addressed one by one.

## Artifacts

- [openapi.yml](openapi.yml) -- OpenAPI 3.1 of the shared operations. No one serves it; it
  is the shape to map to. Lints clean against the
  [naming ruleset](https://github.com/api-commons/schema-commons/blob/main/ruleset/schema-commons-naming.yaml).
- [schema/](schema) -- JSON Schema 2020-12 per concept; each property carries
  `x-commons-tier`, `x-commons-share`, `x-commons-providers` and the spellings seen.
- [crosswalk/](crosswalk) -- one per provider, common name -> their name, with the harvested
  spec and operations each mapping was read from.
- [adopters.yml](adopters.yml) -- who exposes which concept, linked to their APIs.io page.
- [concepts.yml](concepts.yml) -- the only hand-written input: concepts, path segments and
  their qualifiers, aliases, reviewed exclusions, merged duplicates, and the decisions below.
- [census/](census) -- the cohort and the raw census the profile is built from.

## Decisions

These are calls, not measurements, recorded so they can be revisited as the method matures.

- Indexes cover indices, collections and namespaces beneath a search or vector path, and engines and corpora; merchandising collections are excluded.
- A search query is `/search`: a result shape, like the maps concepts, not a resource.
- Duplicates merged: Depict, Gist into ProRata, TiDB into PingCAP.
